Following this period, Ralf and the club have agreed that he will continue in a consultancy role for a further two years. John Murtough, Manchester United football director, said: "Ralf is one of the most respected coaches and innovators in European football. He was our number one candidate for interim manager, reflecting the invaluable leadership and technical skills he will bring from almost four decades of experience in management and coaching. Everyone at the club is looking forward to working with him during the season ahead, and then for a further two years in his advisory role." Ralf Rangnick said: "I am excited to be joining Manchester United and focused on making this a succesful season for the club. The squad is full of talent and has a great balance of youth and experience. All my efforts for the next six months will be on helping these players fulfill their potential, both individually and most importantly, as a team. Beyond that, i look forward to supporting the club's longer-term goals on a consultancy basis."

    <p><mark><strong>Raheem Sterling open to Manchester City Exit.</strong></mark> Manchester City forward Raheem Sterling says he has dreams of playing abroad and would like to challenge himself outside the premier league. Despite playing a significant role for England during this summer's Euro 2020 tournament, the 26 year-old has struggled to hold down a regular place in Pep Guardiola's side this calendar year. It should be recallled that the English man netted 30 goals in 51 appearances during the 2019/20 campaign. However, his goal tally of 14 in last season's campaign has just earned him two starts in this seaon's premier league. Speaking at the FT Business of Sport US Summit, Sterling said: "If there was an opportunity to go somewhere else,(for more game time), I would be open to it at this moment in time. As i said, football is the most important thing to me - challenges that i have set myself from a young age and dreams as well, to play abroad. As an English player all i know is the premier league and i have always had something down(in me) that maybe one day I would love to play abroad to see how I would come up against that challenge. I'm not a person that's going to complain. I've not tried to make it a bigger deal than it actually is. I get on with my work, do what I need to do. And I'm just raring to go - playing football matches regularly, score goals regularly. From being a young child, fooball has been the most important thing in my life, my most happiest I should say. If I want my happiness at acertain level I need to be playing football. I need to be scoring goals and enjoying myself."</p>
